# STT-TTS
By default, uses default audio input and output for recording and playback.  

Pressing Alt + NumPadPlus will process the last 3 seconds of audio from the
microphone.  

Text sent into stdin will be sent directly to tts.

Windows installation may require `windows-build-tools` to be installed globally
as well.
