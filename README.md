# STT-TTS
By default, uses default audio input and output devices for recording and playback.  

Pressing `F2` will process the last 2 seconds of audio from the microphone.  
Pressing `Meta + u` will play the last 2 seconds of audio from the microphone
directly to the output.

Text sent into stdin will be sent directly to tts.

Windows installation may require `windows-build-tools` to be installed globally
as well.
